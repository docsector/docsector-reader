## Showcase

Here is how headings appear when rendered from Markdown:

## This is an H2

### This is an H3

#### This is an H4

##### This is an H5

###### This is an H6

Each heading above creates an anchor in the right-side ToC tree. Click on any heading to navigate directly to it. Notice how the URL hash updates and the ToC tree highlights the selected heading.

## Usage in Markdown

Simply use standard Markdown heading syntax in your `.md` content files:

```
## Main Section
Content here...

### Sub-Section
More content...

#### Detail
Even more content...
```

DPageSection automatically maps each heading level to the corresponding DH component.
